# Restricted Packages Configuration
# =============================================================================
# These packages need to be built from source due to licensing restrictions
#
# Format guidelines:
# - Add packages to RESTRICTED_PACKAGES array
# - One package per line for easy management
# - Add comments explaining why the package is restricted

# Void packages repository settings
VOID_PACKAGES_DIR="$HOME/void-packages"
VOID_PACKAGES_REPO="https://github.com/void-linux/void-packages.git"

# Restricted packages to build and install
RESTRICTED_PACKAGES=(
    "discord"                # Chat and voice communication platform

# Combine all restricted packages (modify this if you add new categories)

    "${RESTRICTED_PACKAGES[@]}"
    # "${RESTRICTED_GAMING_PACKAGES[@]}"      # Uncomment to include

# =============================================================================
# Easy Management Tips:
# =============================================================================
# 1. To add a new restricted package:
#    - Add to appropriate category above with a comment
#    - Make sure it exists in void-packages repo
#    - Check: ls ~/void-packages/srcpkgs/package-name
#
# 2. To enable additional categories:
#    - Uncomment the category in ALL_RESTRICTED_PACKAGES array
#
# 3. To remove a restricted package:
#    - Comment out the line with #
#    - Or delete the line entirely
#
# 4. To check if a package is restricted:
#    - Look in ~/void-packages/srcpkgs/package-name/template
#    - Check for "restricted=yes"
#
# 5. Building takes time:
#    - Large packages like browsers can take 30+ minutes
#    - Consider building overnight for multiple packages
#
# 6. Changes take effect on next run of install.sh
#
# 7. Troubleshooting build failures:
#    - Check ~/void-packages/hostdir/logs/
#    - Build log: ~/void-packages/hostdir/logs/package_build.log
